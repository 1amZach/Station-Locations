# Station-Locations

This repository is a public collection of Station Locations created for Station Alert (SA).  
SA is a paid FiveM resource available for purchase [here](https://store.inferno-collection.com/package/station-alert).

A Station Location is an entry in a Lua file, created using the [SA Tool](https://docs.inferno-collection.com/resources/station-alert/developers/tool), that enables a Fire Station interior/MLO/map to be used by SA. A single Lua file can contain multiple Station Locations. These Lua files, called Draft Files as they can be loaded as Drafts by the [SA Tool](https://docs.inferno-collection.com/resources/station-alert/developers/tool), can be read by SA when the resource is started to dynamically load Station Locations.

***

If you run a server using SA and want to add Station Locations from this resource, ensure you only use Station Locations for interiors/MLOS/maps that are in your server, or else you will see floating/incorrect SA props.

If your interiors/MLOs/maps are not listed here, or you want to customize existing ones to your liking, use the easy-to-use [SA Tool](https://docs.inferno-collection.com/resources/station-alert/developers/tool).

If you are contributing to this repository, thank you! Station Locations should be categorized by author, and then map name - for example: `"inferno_chris/inferno_fire_station/"`, then the Station Location file.
